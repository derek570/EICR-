/**
 * Insulation resistance schema for the dialogue engine. Replaces
 * insulation-resistance-script.js.
 *
 * Slots: L-L (live to live) → L-E (live to earth) → test voltage, in
 * that order. Voltage uses `exclusiveWhenExpected: true` so that when
 * voltage is the asked-for slot, only the voltage parser runs on the
 * bare text — no L-L / L-E named extraction. This mirrors the legacy
 * script's `phase === 'voltage'` branch (which also silently finishes
 * after a voltage attempt, parseable or not). The engine handles the
 * silent-finish via the same exclusive-slot path.
 *
 * Wire shape, log event names, and tool-call-id prefix are preserved
 * byte-identically to the legacy script.

    // "live to live", "line to line", "L to L", "L L" / "LL" / "L-L" / "L.L".
    //
    // Label-to-value bridge has TWO branches, both restrictive:
    //   (a) bare form: 0-6 chars of non-letter/non-digit punctuation/whitespace
    //       only. Catches "L-L 200", "L-L: 200", "L-L,  200" (multi-space),
    //       "L-L=200", "L-L >299", "L-L infinite", "L-L OL".
    //   (b) connector form: lead-in punctuation, then an EXPLICIT connector
    //       word — anchored at BOTH ends — from a small allowlist (is, was,
    //       of, reads, measures, equals, came in/out/up at, tested at, =).
    //       Then a TIGHT 0-3 char whitespace/comma gap before the value.
    //       Catches "L-L is 200", "L-L is greater than 299", "L-L tested
    //       at 999", "L-L was 50".
    //
    // Word-boundary `\\b` at the END of each connector is load-bearing:
    // without it, "is" would match the leading two chars of "isolation"
    // and let the value-group's `\\bo\\s*l\\b` saturation sentinel match
    // "ol" mid-word ("isolation" → ">999" L-L certification). Same risk
    // class applies to "tolerance", "old", "voltage" — all matched by
    // the value group's `o\\s*l` branch in MEGAOHMS_VALUE_GROUP before
    // that group itself was word-anchored (defence in depth — see the
    // companion change in parsers/megaohms.js).
    //
    // Why the connector allowlist (vs the previous `[^\\d∞]{0,30}?` open
    // gap): the open gap accepted arbitrary letters between label and value,
    // which let bad utterances capture the wrong number — e.g.
    //   "live to live for circuit 3 is greater than 299"
    //     → gap consumed " for circuit ", value group's `\\d*\\.?\\d+` branch
    //       matched the bare digit "3", and L-L was certified as 3 megaohms
    //   "live to live voltage 500"
    //     → gap consumed " v", value group's `o\\s*l` saturation sentinel
    //       matched the "ol" inside "voltage" and L-L was certified as ">999"
    // Both are safety-critical wrong readings on an EICR. The connector
    // allowlist closes both holes while still supporting the natural
    // "is greater than X" form that motivated the original relaxation
    // (session 8782CB67-…-540F8A circuit 3, 2026-06-02 field repro).
    //
    // Trade-off acknowledged: utterances that link the label to the value
    // via a connector NOT in the allowlist (e.g. "live to live around 200",
    // "live to live IR 500") fall back to a no-match and the engine asks
    // for the value — same surface as a Deepgram-garbled label. Extend the
    // connector list only when field telemetry shows a real omission, not
    // pre-emptively.
    // 2026-06-03 (session 284CBBCD) — split into TWO capture groups
    // so the BARE-bridge arm can use the restricted
    // MEGAOHMS_BARE_SAFE_VALUE_GROUP (no single-digit bare integers)
    // while the CONNECTOR arm keeps the full MEGAOHMS_VALUE_GROUP.
    //
    // Repro: a Flux-garbled utterance "L L 2 L E greater than 299"
    // (likely a fragmented or coalesced rendering of the inspector
    // saying just "Greater than 299" inside an active IR walk-through)
    // pre-fix produced TWO writes: L-L=2 + L-E=>299, leaving the
    // cooker certified with an implausibly low L-L insulation
    // reading. Post-fix the bare-arm rejects "2" (single-digit
    // integer via the loose bridge), only L-E is named-matched, and
    // the engine re-asks L-L on the next turn.
    //
    // Phase 4 (audit-2026-06-02) widened extractNamedFieldValues to
    // read m[1] ?? m[2] ?? m[3], so multi-group regexes work without
