/**
 * Confirmation-TTS FIFO queue — web port of the iOS "TTS FIFO Queue"
 * (AlertManager Phase 7.1, `CertMateUnified/Sources/Recording/AlertManager.swift:236-355`
 * + the pump/resume/purge machinery at `:1576-1896`).
 *
 * WHY this exists: pre-fix the web confirmation path
 * (`recording-context.tsx onExtraction` → `speakConfirmation`) cancelled
 * the in-flight utterance on EVERY new confirmation (`speakElevenLabs`
 * calls `cancelElevenLabs()` at its top). So a Sonnet turn that read back
 * TWO circuit renames fired both ~5ms apart and only the LAST was heard —
 * a direct violation of Audio-First invariant #1 ("every dictated reading
 * read back, exactly once, never zero"). iOS does NOT cancel; it FIFO-queues
 * confirmations so back-to-back read-backs play in order. This module is the
 * web analogue.
 *
 * SCOPE — confirmations (+ future fast-path TTS) ONLY. iOS Phase 7.1 is
 * deliberately confirmations/fast-path only; `speakAlertMessage` /
 * `speakResponse` / `ask_user` prompts run through the SEPARATE direct
 * `speakWithTTS` path with their own single `deferredTTS` slot. Routing an
 * `ask_user` disambiguation question through this FIFO would make it wait
 * behind up to 6 queued read-backs — strictly worse than today. So the
 * direct `speak()` path stays in `tts.ts` and PREEMPTS this queue via
 * `preemptFlush()`; only `speakConfirmation()` enqueues here.
 *
 * DESIGN — framework-free, unit-testable against a fake clock + injected
 * player. The audio player is dependency-INJECTED per call (`item.play`),
 * NOT imported, so there is no `tts.ts` ↔ `tts-queue.ts` circular import.
 * The injected player must guarantee EXACTLY ONE terminal callback per head
 * (`onEnd` OR `onError`) and must call `controls.onStart` at the moment real
 * audio begins (this drives `startedPlayback`, the "was it ever heard?"
 * flag used by every teardown path).
 *
 * NEVER a permanent read-back drop (Audio-First #1): the caller records a
 * confirmation's dedupe key at enqueue. Any item discarded WITHOUT ever
 * starting playback (`startedPlayback === false`) — an overflow drop-oldest,
 * a `reset()` / `purge()` / `preemptFlush()`, a deferred head, OR the current
 * head torn down mid-fetch/pre-playback — fires the injected `onDiscarded(key)`
 * SYNCHRONOUSLY so the caller un-records the key and the backend can re-speak
 * it on a later re-emit. Items with `startedPlayback === true` keep their key
 * (they were heard).
 */
