# iOS ↔ PWA Parity Backlog

Rollup of gaps surfaced by the eight-phase parity audit (Wave A, 2026-04-24). Each line links to a phase report; detailed gap bodies live there.

Audit methodology & prompt templates: `~/.claude/plans/we-ve-just-finished-a-enumerated-hellman.md`.
Guiding rule: **iOS is canon. Divergence is a bug unless explicitly documented** (`~/.claude/projects/-Users-derekbeckley-Developer-EICR-Automation/memory/feedback_ios_is_canon_for_parity.md`).

## Phase status — ALL DONE

| Phase | Scope | Report | Gaps (P0 / P1 / P2) |
|-------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Tab structure & cert-type gating | `phase-1-tab-structure.md` | 8 (4 / 2 / 2) |
| 2 | Dashboard & job list | `phase-2-dashboard.md` | 17 (7 / 7 / 3) |
| 3 | Shared job tabs (Overview, Installation, Supply, Board, Circuits) | `phase-3-shared-tabs.md` | 27 (9 / 13 / 5) |
| 4 | Cert-gated tabs (Inspection, Observations, Extent, Design) | `phase-4-cert-gated-tabs.md` | 14 (8 / 4 / 2) |
| 5 | Staff / PDF tabs | `phase-5-staff-pdf.md` | 14 (7 / 5 / 2) |
| 6 | Recording pipeline UI | `phase-6-recording.md` | 22 (7 / 10 / 5) |
| 7 | Settings (hub / staff / company / admin) | `phase-7-settings.md` | 52 (13 / 26 / 13) |
| 8 | CCU + Document extraction + Fuseboard matcher | `phase-8-ccu-and-docs.md` | 16 (6 / 7 / 3) |
| **Total** |  |  | **170 (61 / 74 / 35)** |

Exceptions (documented, intentional): 3 (Phase 3 Circuits mobile card-view; Phase 8 × 2).

## Cross-cutting themes (multiple phases)

1. **InspectorProfile shape drift (3-way)** — iOS `firstName`/`lastName` + 10 equipment fields; PWA has ≥3 incompatible shapes across `staff/page.tsx`, `lib/types.ts`, and `@certmate/shared-types`. Touches Phases 1, 5, 7. Risk: silent signature/sign-off data loss.
2. **Outcome / enum drift** — Inspection outcomes, RCD types, polarity, premises chips, OCPD ratings all have enum or casing drift between iOS and PWA (Phases 3, 4). Some PWA values crash iOS decode (`✗`, `FI`).
3. **Data-bucket / key-casing drift** — Web JSON shapes use snake_case under different section keys (`installation` / `supply` / `board.boards`) vs iOS camelCase (`installationDetails` / `supplyCharacteristics` / `boards`) and different schedule-flag keys (`mark_section_7_na` vs iOS `mark_section7_na`). Phases 3, 4.
4. **Dead / orphan code from rebuild refactors** — `LiveFillView` imported nowhere (Phase 6); `sendJobStateUpdate` defined but uncalled (Phase 8); `/observations` route orphaned (Phase 1); three Circuits action-rail buttons stubbed (Phase 3). Cosmetically the features exist; functionally they don't.
5. **Deepgram config drift** — `utterance_end_ms`, keyterm prompting, 25s heartbeat, 3-tier VAD all diverge (Phase 6). Direct violation of the global rule in `~/.claude/rules/mistakes.md`.
6. **Missing whole subsystems on PWA** — Defaults (Phase 7), Change Password (Phase 7), 3-mode CCU matcher + review sheet (Phase 8), Terms & Conditions gate (Phase 2), preset picker on job creation (Phase 2), PDF generation (Phase 5 — Generate/Preview/Share are stubs).

## P0 — functional or gating bugs (61)

### Phase 1 (4)
- [ ] [Phase 1#gap-1] Observations orphaned on EICR (tab removed, replacement FAB button never built)
- [ ] [Phase 1#gap-2] FAB only renders Mic — no Obs button despite the comment claiming there is one
- [ ] [Phase 1#gap-3] Extent tab shown on EICR; iOS gates to EIC
- [ ] [Phase 1#gap-4] Design tab shown on EICR; iOS gates to EIC

### Phase 2 (7)
- [ ] [Phase 2] No Terms & Conditions gate after login — iOS `RootView` blocks until signed
- [ ] [Phase 2] Recent Jobs hard-capped at 8 with no "view all"; jobs >8 unreachable
- [ ] [Phase 2] No preset picker / Defaults entry on job creation (iOS `autoApplyDefaults` flow absent)
- [ ] [Phase 2] No swipe / overflow delete on job rows
- [ ] [Phase 2] Setup & Tools missing Defaults + Tour tiles
- [ ] [Phase 2] (2 more — see phase-2 report)

### Phase 3 (9)
- [ ] [Phase 3#gap-1] Tab-data buckets diverge (`installation`/`supply`/`board.boards` vs iOS `installationDetails`/`supplyCharacteristics`/`boards`) — root cause of many field misses
- [ ] [Phase 3#gap-28] Circuits action-rail: Delete / Apply Defaults / Calculate are "not available yet" stubs
- [ ] [Phase 3#gap-16] Earthing-conductor continuity: free-text on web, PASS/FAIL/LIM on iOS
- [ ] [Phase 3#gap-18] Bonding / extraneous-bond continuity: same divergence
- [ ] [Phase 3] TT side-effects, main-switch pickers, missing circuit fields, Fed-from picker (4 more — see phase-3 report)

### Phase 4 (8)
- [ ] [Phase 4#gap-9] Inspection outcome enum divergence — PWA `✗`, `FI` crash iOS decode; iOS `NV` absent on PWA
- [ ] [Phase 4#gap-10] Inspection items shape: iOS tagged object vs PWA bare Record — iOS silently wipes all rows when web-saved EICR opens on iPhone
- [ ] [Phase 4#gap-11] Schedule flag key drift `mark_section_7_na` (PWA) vs `mark_section7_na` (iOS canon) — supersedes Phase 1 Gap #6
- [ ] [Phase 4#gap-12] No linked-observation plumbing: tapping C1/C2/C3 on a schedule row does nothing beyond setting the outcome string
- [ ] [Phase 4] (4 more — see phase-4 report)

### Phase 5 (7)
- [ ] [Phase 5#gap-5.5] PWA PDF Generate / Preview / Share are disabled stubs — inspectors must still open iOS to produce a cert
- [ ] [Phase 5#gap-5.1] Staff roster never fetched (`api.inspectorProfiles` has no call site) — every role picker permanently empty — carries Phase 1 Gap #5
- [ ] [Phase 5#gap-5.3] Three incompatible InspectorProfile shapes in the repo (silent data-disappearance latent under the fetch bug)
- [ ] [Phase 5] (4 more — see phase-5 report)

### Phase 6 (7)
- [ ] [Phase 6] LiveFillView imported nowhere — the entire live dashboard is dead code
- [ ] [Phase 6] Deepgram `utterance_end_ms` drift: PWA 2000 vs iOS 1500
- [ ] [Phase 6] No keyterm prompting on PWA Deepgram URL (iOS passes ~89 boost-scored keyterms; PWA 0)
- [ ] [Phase 6] No 25s ALB-defeating heartbeat; no Sonnet question rendering; 2-tier field priority instead of 3-tier; no regex layer; no transcript buffering during reconnect; no `observation_update` handler (several more — see phase-6 report)

### Phase 7 (13)
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7F-1] Entire Defaults area absent from PWA (no `/settings/defaults/*` route)
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7G-1] Change Password page entirely missing
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7B-1] Inspector `firstName`/`lastName` vs flat `name` drift — PWA profiles land on iOS with empty lastName
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7D-3] Admin/create: company picker is a free-form UUID input
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7C-1] Company: 5-field address collapsed to one textarea
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7D-6] Failed-login-attempts counter absent
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7H-1] Version / About section absent
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7E-2] Employee filter missing on company dashboard
- [ ] [Phase 7#P0-7B-2] `organisation` + `enrolment_number` write-only from PWA / invisible on iOS detail view
- [ ] [Phase 7] (4 more — see phase-7 report)

### Phase 8 (6)
- [ ] [Phase 8#gap-1] PWA has no three-mode CCU selector (Names-only / Hardware-update / Full) — inspectors cannot pick correct merge behaviour
- [ ] [Phase 8#gap-3] Fuzzy matcher absent — PWA keys by `circuit_ref` only, renumbered boards silently re-attach readings to wrong circuits
- [ ] [Phase 8#gap-2] No `CircuitMatchReviewView` on PWA — hardware-update applies patches immediately with no user-visible diff
- [ ] [Phase 8#gap-4] `sendJobStateUpdate` defined but uncalled — Sonnet snapshot goes stale after mid-session CCU updates
- [ ] [Phase 8#gap-5] No pending-extractions queue — lost photos on network failure
- [ ] [Phase 8#gap-13] No PDF document-extraction support (iOS renders PDFs locally)

## P1 — polish / drift (74)

Full list in each phase report. Notable themes: postcode autocomplete, inspection-years picker, inline inspector pickers, RCD quick-set buttons, N/A previous-date, confirm-dialog copy, WideCircuitsPanel column order, hero-key drift, PDF warning-set drift (iOS 3 vs PWA 7-9, disjoint), cost-display format, and 10 Deepgram-config tuning gaps. See each phase's **## Gap #N** entries marked `[P1]`.

## P2 — code-only drift (35)

Dead props, JSDoc referencing non-existent memos, shared-types backports, unused type parameters. See each phase report.

## Exceptions — intentional divergence (3)

- **Phase 3** — Circuits mobile card-view (author-flagged as deliberate trade-off at `web/src/app/job/[id]/circuits/page.tsx:30-47`).
- **Phase 8** — 2 documented exceptions (see phase-8 report).

## Open questions still outstanding

- **[Phase 1 Q3 / Phase 4]** Inspection schedule flag wire-key: iOS emits `mark_section7_na`; PWA `mark_section_7_na`. Phase 4 says iOS is canonical. Verify the backend column's actual stored key before choosing "rename column" vs "alias both in API layer".
- **[Phase 4 / Phase 5]** Outcome / InspectorProfile drift: before fixing the PWA, confirm whether any live production data on `eicr-db-production` has already been written in the drifted shapes. If yes, a migration/backfill is needed alongside the client fix.

## Recommended next steps (Wave B — fix)

Given 61 P0s, fix in priority order of **blast radius**, not phase order:

1. **Data-shape P0s first** (schedule items, outcome enums, tab data buckets, InspectorProfile, schedule-flag casing) — Phases 3/4/5/7. These are the cross-platform data-corruption risks; fix them before any round-trip tests run.
2. **Structural tab/nav P0s** — Phase 1 (4 gaps) + Phase 2 T&Cs gate + Phase 2 job list cap. Small file counts, high user impact.
3. **Subsystem stubs** — PDF generation (Phase 5), Change Password (Phase 7), Defaults (Phase 7), three-mode CCU matcher + review (Phase 8). Biggest code effort; schedule deliberately.
4. **Deepgram + Recording config drift** — Phase 6 (all P0s in one file). Ship once tested against a recording session.
5. **P1s swept in batches by file** — group by `web/src/app/job/[id]/*/page.tsx` so each PR touches ~1 file.
6. **P2s last** — mechanical cleanup, low value, do in a single "hygiene" PR.
